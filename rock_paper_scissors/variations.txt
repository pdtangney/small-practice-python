# Also listed are other uses for the code, such as reusing it as part of another
game.

	* Every 5 games the computer always chooses paper.
	Use this in testing. Without seeing the code, can players spot a pattern in
	the choices the computer makes?
	This is also a potentially good exercise in AI and ALGORITHM development.

	* Clue/whodoneit
		Display to the player, a lsit of possible weapons, rooms, and suspects.
		The computer randomly chooses one of each, and the user has to guess
		what the computer is holding.
		If the player guesses one of the three items, let them know. Except on
		hardest difficulty level.
		Give the user points. The fewer guesses the greater the points.
			Mabye start out with 100 points for the first guess. If wrong,
			second guess is worth 90 points, etc.
		Build in a hint system
		Add a hall of fame
		
	* Guess the color
		Out of Red, Green, Blue, user guesses the computer's color.
		Modify R,P,S:
			RPS  tied = RGB user wins
			RPS lose = stays the same
			RPS win, we get rid of. e.g.: user picks green, computer had blue.
			colors cannot beat each other, thus this code not needed.

RockPaperScissors2.py 2/20/14 - 3/1/14
Unfinished version??
	I'm not sure what happened here. On 2/10/20 I merely glanced at the code,
	then gave up looking at it for now. Remember, I am relearning Python at the
	moment.

RockPaperScissors3.py 2/10/20
Cleaned up code from version 1. Version 2 seems to be something I forgot about.
Added intro()
Added game_rules() 
	Empty at the moment. To be filled in soon.
Changed function names from camelCase to under_score to differentiate between 
functions and variables.
Added gamesLost and GamesTied variables to keep track of lost, tied games.
Got rid of a redundant print() in type_in_move()
	Consolidated input() to input().lower() reducing another line of code
removed multiple empty print(). using \n instead
Cleaned up the display of statistics, including accounting for pluralization.
e.g. 'You won 1 game' vs 'You won 1 games.'
Stats now shows how many games played, lost, won, and is updated on each round.

# small-practice-python
A collection of small practice projects of my own, written in Python 3

The programs here are very beginner oriented, because, well I am a beginning programmer. Most of these programs will be console programs
and won't require external modules, in order to keep things simple. However, I am experimenting with some external modules such as pygame
and pyinputplus.
